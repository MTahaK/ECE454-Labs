<Elden Ring>, a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, introduces players to an expansive open world through a third-person perspective. 
Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding contributions from fantasy writer George R.R. Martin, <Elden Ring> was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. 
<Elden Ring> sets players to roam the Lands Between, traversing six main areas using the spectral steed Torrent and engaging in major, linear dungeons known as "Legacy Dungeons," each ended off by a major demigod boss fight. 
<Elden Ring> features combat with various weapons and magic spells, including stealth mechanics for non-direct engagement. The game's world, filled with checkpoints for fast travel, allows players to improve their attributes using in-game currency called runes.
Planning for <Elden Ring> began post-release of "The Ringed City" DLC for Dark Souls III, with Miyazaki directing alongside the development of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. 
The design team focused on environmental scale, role-playing, and storytelling for <Elden Ring>, as the team's first open-world game. 
Players start <Elden Ring> by choosing a character class, determining starting spells, equipment, and attributes.
Combat in <Elden Ring> can be melee or ranged, with the ability to dodge or block enemy attacks and enhance weapons with spells.
A derivative of the 'Soulslike' format that FromSoftware pioneered, <Elden Ring> also introduces jumping, jump attacks, and crouching mechanics.
Set in the Lands Between, previously ruled by the immortal Queen Marika, the keeper of the Elden Ring, <Elden Ring> unfolds a story where the player, as a Tarnished, is summoned to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord. On their journey, players face-off against Shardbearers: powerful legends, often of demigod status, that have each seized the power of a shard of the shattered Elden Ring.
<Elden Ring> received critical acclaim for its world, gameplay systems, and setting, despite some technical performance issues. 
Winning multiple Game of the Year awards, <Elden Ring> sold over 20 million copies within a year and announced an expansion, "Shadow of the Erdtree," in February 2023, cementing itself as FromSoftware's greatest release to date.
<Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon> was FromSoftware's next release after the monumental success of <Elden Ring>.
Given the company's decade-long hiatus from the Armored Core series after focusing on the genre-defining Dark Souls franchise, <Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon> incorporates design lessons learned over the company's long history in producing quality games.
<Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon> is the culmination of a decade of monumental releases, and over 10 years of the Armored Core franchise before it.
